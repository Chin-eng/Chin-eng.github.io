## Background

I was born in [Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulaanbaatar), where I completed my elementary, middle, and high school education. During this time, I was actively involved in music, performing at both local and national festivals. I was a member of [Mongolia’s Children’s Palace](https://collections.lib.uwm.edu/digital/collection/agsphoto/id/2733/) music band, playing a variety of musical roles. 

However, starting in 10th grade, I chose to focus on academics and study abroad, leaving my music career behind. In high school, I was passionate about math, physics, and science, participating in various olympiads to hone my skills. I graduated from [Sant High School](https://www.facebook.com/SantSchools/) in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and came to the United States in 2019 to pursue higher education.

## Academics

I’m currently pursuing my education at the [University of Washington, Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/). During my undergraduate years, I hope to not only take the amazing computer science classes offered at the Paul Allen School but also hope to participate in various student clubs, researches, and internships experiences to gain both theoretical knowledge and practical industry skills.

I believe most software development concepts, front and back-end engineering can be learned through industry experience without the need for computer lab or direct professor guidance. Thus, during my undergraduate years, I want to take the classes that require the resources and expertise unique to a university settings. Right now, once I get my fundementals, I’m mostly interested in getting my hands into various different topics, from robotics, computer vision, AI , deep learning, NLP to system development and compiler construction. 

In the future, I want to pursue both academic and industry endeavors. Even though I’m planing to get into an industry after graduation, I also wish to pursue academia to contribute to the broader field of computer science. Hence, I intend to explore various domains, from [Human-Centered Design and Engineering (HCDI)](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/) and [Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-centered_design#:~:text=Human%2Dcentered%20design%20is%20an,and%20usability%20knowledge%20and%20techniques.) to Software Engineering, computer systems, theoretical computer science, and graphics and visualization.

As an avid science fiction fan as a kid, I could not help but to feel excited about the future when I was reading [Walter Isaacson’s new Elon Musk book](https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1982181281). Like human beings can communicate with each other without oral communication using the Neuralink’s chip implant, the Optimus robot being accessible to every household same as personal computer, and humanity going to Mars seem all fascinating prospects. 

In "[The Age of Spiritual Machines](https://www.amazon.com/Age-Spiritual-Machines-Computers-Intelligence/dp/0140282025)," Ray Kurzweil explains how exponential growth drives technological advancement, and [Moore’s Law](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/resources/moores-law.html#:~:text=Moore's%20Law%20is%20the%20observation,original%20paper%20published%20in%201965.) illustrates how computing power continually increases over time. I believe we are in an era where technology is advancing rapidly, blurring the lines between fiction and reality.


## Hobbies

As a hobby, I play musical instrument mainly bass guitar and piano. Also, I usually go on a hiking, or spend time cooking.
