I'm an Associate Professor in the [UW Allen School](http://cs.washington.edu/), a Sloan Fellow, and NSF CAREER Awardee. My research is in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with a focus on high-value social domains such as accessibility, environmental sustainability, and STE(A)M education.

I received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Washington in December 2011 where I was co-advised by Professors [James Landay](https://www.landay.org/) and [Shwetak Patel](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shwetak/). During my PhD, I was honored with a Microsoft Research Graduate Fellowship and selected as the 2010 College of Engineering "Graduate Innovator of the Year." My PhD dissertation entitled "Sensing and Feedback of Everyday Activities to Promote Environmental Behaviors" earned distinctive recognition including the 2012 University of Washington Distinguished Dissertation Award, the William Chan Memorial Dissertation Award, and an *Honorable Mention* for the national 2012 Council of Graduate Schools Distinguished Dissertation Award in Mathematics, Physical Sciences, and Engineering. One part of my dissertation on new water sensing techniques, called HydroSense, was patented, licensed, and commercialized by Belkin, Inc.  

During my graduate studies, I had the opportunity to intern at a number of great research labs including Telefonica Research in Barcelona, Microsoft Research in Redmond, and Intel Research in Seattle. In 2004, I completed a MS in Information and Computer Science from the University of California, Irvine where I was advised by [Paul Dourish](https://www.dourish.com/). From 2012-2017, I was an Assistant Professor in CS at the University of Maryland in College Park.

Throughout my career, I have been fortunate to learn from and collaborate with top scholars and students, leading to 70+ scientific peer-reviewed [publications](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/publications/) in premiere venues such as ACM CHI, UbiComp, IJCAI, MobiSys, ASSETS, and ICSE earning. Fourteen papers have earned awards, including: seven *Best Papers* (CHI'10, CHI'13, ASSETS'13, CHI'16 LBW, 2 x CHI'19, ASSETS'19) and seven *Best Paper Honorable Mentions* (UbiComp'09, CHI'12, CHI'13, 2 x CHI'15, ASSETS'19, CHI'19). In addition, our UIST'14 paper on Tohme was selected for the ACM Computing Reviews 'Best of Computing 2014' list.
