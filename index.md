**Join us!** The Makeability Lab is recruiting new PhD students or Postdocs interested in urban accessibility with background in data science, GIS, and/or computer vision. You will work with our vibrant, cross-disciplinary [Project Sidewalk](https://projectsidewalk.org/) team on state-of-the-art projects in Crowd+AI to map, assess, and visualize urban accessibility. <br/><br/>If interested, please begin by reading our [Makeability Lab handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YiiDsfpiolpXjUTj8xWrQwQQUzqrfqT9bocOpaYDrtI) and our recent papers in the area on the [Makeability Lab website](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/publications/). See also our ["Future of Urban Accessibility"](https://accessiblecities.github.io/UrbanAccess2022/pdfs/Froehlich_FutureOfUrbanAccessibility_ASSETS2022WorkshopProposal.pdf) short paper at ASSETS'22 and the [accompanying workshop website](https://accessiblecities.github.io/UrbanAccess2022/). Then, email me at [jonf@cs.uw.edu](jonf@cs.uw.edu) with "Prospective PhD Student (or Postdoc) in UrbanAccess" in the subject. Include your CV and a relevancy statement about how your prior work and future interests intersect with my lab.

Hi ðŸ‘‹,

I'm Jon, an Associate Professor in Human-Computer Interaction at UW's [Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://cs.washington.edu/) where I work with an extraordinary set of [students and collaborators](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/people/) on problems related to accessibility, urban informatics, environmental sustainability, and STE(A)M education.

At UW, I direct the [Makeability Lab](http://makeabilitylab.io/) and am the Associate Director of [CREATE](https://create.uw.edu/) (Center for Research and Education on Accessible Technology and Experiences), Associate Director of Tech Transfer and Outreach of [PacTrans](http://depts.washington.edu/pactrans/), Faculty Chair of the [MHCI+D program](https://mhcid.washington.edu/), and co-founder of [Project Sidewalk](http://projectsidewalk.org/), a web tool aimed at transforming how sidewalks are mapped, analyzed, and visualized using crowdsourcing+AI. I also serve as a Core Faculty Member in the [Interdisciplinary PhD Program in Urban Design and Planning](https://grad.uw.edu/about-the-graduate-school/interdisciplinary-programs/urban-design-and-planning/) within the UW Graduate School.

<!-- a co-founding (student) member of [DUB](http://dub.washington.edu), a large, cross-disciplinary organization of academic and industry professionals interested in HCI and Design research,

I am the General Chair for [ASSETS'22](https://assets22.sigaccess.org/), the premier ACM conference for research on the design, evaluation, use, and education related to computing for people with disabilities and older adults.  -->

## Students

One of the great privileges of being a professor is working with students. In the [Makeability Lab](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/), we work with students across multiple disciplines and levels from high school to PhD. For a full list, see the [Makeability Lab's People page](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/people/).

### Makeability Lab PhD Students

If you're interested in working with me, please read our [Makeability Lab Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YiiDsfpiolpXjUTj8xWrQwQQUzqrfqT9bocOpaYDrtI). I currently advise these fantastic students:

* [Xia Su](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/member/xiasu/), creativity support tools and indoor accessibility
* [Daniel Campos Zamora](https://www.danielcamposzamora.com/), prototyping indoor and outdoor navigation techniques
* [Chu Li](https://www.chu-li.me/), advancing urban science through interactive technology
* [Jaewook Lee](https://jaewook-lee.com/), re-imagining augmented reality for all

I also work closely with HCDE PhD students [Steven Goodman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-m-goodman/) and [Emma McDonnell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ejmcdonnell/) on sound recognition and captioning tools to support people who are deaf or hard of hearing with Co-PI [Professor Leah Findlater](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/findlater) ([NSF #1763199](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1763199&HistoricalAwards=false))

## Teaching

In the Allen School, I teach CS courses that explore the materiality of computing and the ever-changing relationships between humans, bits, and atoms such as CSE490 _Physical Computing_, CSE590 _Ubiquitous Computing_, and CSE599 _Prototyping Interactive Systems_. I also co-teach HCID521 _Prototyping Studio_ in the [Master of Human-Computer Interaction Design (MHCI+D)](https://mhcid.washington.edu/) program. Topics across these courses include prototyping with electronics, microcontrollers, code, 3D printers, and lo-fi craft material. See our [teaching website](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/physcomp/) for more details.
