Hi ðŸ‘‹,

I'm Jon, an Associate Professor in Human-Computer Interaction at UW's [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://cs.washington.edu/) where I work with an extraordinary set of [students and collaborators](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/people/) on problems related to accessibility, urban informatics, environmental sustainability, and STEM education. See our [lab website](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/) for details.

At UW, I direct the [Makeability Lab](http://makeabilitylab.io/) within the Allen School and am core faculty in [Urban Design and Planning](https://urbdp.be.uw.edu/). I am also Associate Director of [CREATE](https://create.uw.edu/) (Center for Research and Education on Accessible Technology and Experiences), Faculty Chair of the [MHCI+D program](https://mhcid.washington.edu/), a co-founding member of [DUB](http://dub.washington.edu), a large, cross-disciplinary organization of academic and industry professionals interested in HCI and Design research, and co-founder of [Project Sidewalk](http://projectsidewalk.org/), a web tool aimed at transforming how sidewalks are mapped, analyzed, and visualized using crowdsourcing+AI.

For 2021-2022, I will be the General Chair for [ASSETS'22](https://assets22.sigaccess.org/), the premier ACM conference for research on the design, evaluation, use, and education related to computing for people with disabilities and older adults. 

### PhD Students
One of the great privileges of being a professor is working with students. I have the pleasure of working with the following PhD students:

* [Manaswi Saha](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~manaswi/), interactive tools to support advocacy, urban planning, and policy making for urban accessibility
* [Liang He](http://www.lianghe.me/), HCI + digital fabrication
* [Dhruv Jain](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~djain/), sound sensing and access tools for people who are Deaf or hard of hearing
* [Jesse Martinez](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jessejm/), accessibility tools for new media and games
* [Katherine Juarez](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/member/katherinejuarez/), tools to study the evolution and impact of urban accessibility over time
* [Lisa Orii](https://lisaorii.github.io/), examining urban accessibility + social equity issues
* [Xia Su](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/member/xiasu/),creativity support and design tools
* [Daniel Campos Zamora](https://www.danielcamposzamora.com/), prototyping new ways to navigate indoor and outdoor spaces

In the [Makeability Lab](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/), we work with students across multiple disciplines and levels from high school to PhD. For a full list, see the [Makeability Lab's People page](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/people/). 

### Teaching
In the Allen School, I teach CS courses that explore the materiality of computing and the ever-changing relationships between humans, bits, and atoms such as CSE490 _Physical Computing_, CSE590 _Ubiquitous Computing_, and CSE599 _Prototyping Interactive Systems_. I also co-teach HCID521 _Prototyping Studio_ in the [Master of Human-Computer Interaction Design (MHCI+D)](https://mhcid.washington.edu/) program. Topics across these courses include prototyping with electronics, microcontrollers, code, 3D printers, and lo-fi craft material. See our [teaching website](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/physcomp/) for more details.

### Acknowledgments and funding
The [Makeability Lab](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu) is grateful for funding support from the NSF, the Department of Defense's Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine Research Program, the [PacTrans Consortium](http://depts.washington.edu/pactrans/),  [UW CREATE](https://create.uw.edu/), [UW's Global Innovation Fund](https://www.washington.edu/globalaffairs/gif/), and [the UW Reality Lab](https://realitylab.uw.edu/) as well as corporate sponsors, including: Google Faculty Research Awards, a 3M Faculty Award, and research funding from Facebook, Nokia, and Microsoft. We are also grateful for our PhD student funding awards, including two Google PhD Fellowships, an IBM Fellowship, and a [Microsoft Dissertation Grant](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/dissertation-grant/?OCID=msr_program_dissgrant_tw#!grant-recipients).

We are honored and humbled that our work has been recognized with sixteen Best Paper and Honorable Mention Awards, including five Best Papers at CHI, two Best Papers at ASSETS, and a 10-Year Impact Award at UbiComp.
