Hi ðŸ‘‹,

I'm Jon, an Associate Professor in Human-Computer Interaction at UW's [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://cs.washington.edu/) where I work with an extraordinary set of [students and collaborators](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/people/) on problems related to accessibility, urban informatics, environmental sustainability, and STEM education.

At UW, I direct the [Makeability Lab](http://makeabilitylab.io/) and am an Associate Director of [CREATE](https://create.uw.edu/), an Executive Committee member of the [MHCI+D program](https://mhcid.washington.edu/), and a co-founding member of [DUB](http://dub.washington.edu), a large, cross-disciplinary organization of academic and industry professionals interested in HCI and Design research. I'm also the co-founder of [Project Sidewalk](http://projectsidewalk.org/), a web tool aimed at transforming how sidewalks are mapped, analyzed, and visualized using crowdsourcing+AI.

In the Allen School, I teach CS courses that explore the materiality of computing and the ever-changing relationships between bits and atoms such as CSE490 _Physical Computing_, CSE590 _Ubiquitous Computing_, and CSE599 _Prototyping Interactive Systems_. I also co-teach Prototyping Studio in the [Master of Human-Computer Interaction Design (MHCI+D) program](https://mhcid.washington.edu/). Topics across these courses include prototyping with electronics, microcontrollers, code, lo-fi craft material. See our [teaching website](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/physcomp/) for more details.

The [Makeability Lab](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu) is grateful for funding support from the NSF, the Department of Defense's Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine Research Program, the [PacTrans Consortium](http://depts.washington.edu/pactrans/),  [UW CREATE](https://create.uw.edu/), [UW's Global Innovation Fund](https://www.washington.edu/globalaffairs/gif/), and [the UW Reality Lab](https://realitylab.uw.edu/) as well as corporate sponsors, including: Google Faculty Research Awards, a 3M Faculty Award, and research funding from Facebook, Nokia, and Microsoft. We are also grateful for our PhD student funding awards, including two Google PhD Fellowships, an IBM Fellowship, and a [Microsoft Dissertation Grant](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/dissertation-grant/?OCID=msr_program_dissgrant_tw#!grant-recipients).

We are honored and humbled that our work has been recognized with fifteen Best Paper and Honorable Mention Awards, including five Best Papers at CHI, two Best Papers at ASSETS, and a 10-Year Impact Award at UbiComp.
