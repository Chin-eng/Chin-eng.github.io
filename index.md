I'm an Associate Professor in Human-Computer Interaction at UW's [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://cs.washington.edu/) where I work with an extraordinary set of [students and collaborators](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/people/) on problems related to accessibility, urban informatics, environmental sustainability, and STEM education.

At UW, I direct the [Makeability Lab](http://makeabilitylab.io/) and am an Associate Director of [CREATE](https://create.uw.edu/), an Executive Committee member of the [MHCI+D program](https://mhcid.washington.edu/), and a co-founding member of [DUB](http://dub.washington.edu), a large, cross-disciplinary organization of academic and industry professionals interested in HCI and Design research.
