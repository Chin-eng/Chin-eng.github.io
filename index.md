Hi ðŸ‘‹,

I'm Jon, an Associate Professor in Human-Computer Interaction at UW's [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://cs.washington.edu/) where I work with an extraordinary set of [students and collaborators](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/people/) on problems related to accessibility, urban informatics, environmental sustainability, and STEM education. See our [lab website](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/) for details.

### Roles
At UW, I direct the [Makeability Lab](http://makeabilitylab.io/) with the Allen School and am core faculty in [Urban Design and Planning](https://urbdp.be.uw.edu/). I am also an Associate Director of [CREATE](https://create.uw.edu/) (Center for Research and Education on Accessible Technology and Experiences), Executive Committee member of the [MHCI+D program](https://mhcid.washington.edu/), a co-founding member of [DUB](http://dub.washington.edu), a large, cross-disciplinary organization of academic and industry professionals interested in HCI and Design research, and co-founder of [Project Sidewalk](http://projectsidewalk.org/), a web tool aimed at transforming how sidewalks are mapped, analyzed, and visualized using crowdsourcing+AI.

For 2021-2022, I will be the General Chair for ASSETS'22, the premier ACM conference for research on the design, evaluation, use, and education related to computing for people with disabilities and older adults. Please join us for the [ASSETS'21 conference](https://assets21.sigaccess.org/) in October 2021, which will be virtual.

### Teaching
In the Allen School, I teach CS courses that explore the materiality of computing and the ever-changing relationships between humans, bits, and atoms such as CSE490 _Physical Computing_, CSE590 _Ubiquitous Computing_, and CSE599 _Prototyping Interactive Systems_. I also co-teach HCID521 _Prototyping Studio_ in the [Master of Human-Computer Interaction Design (MHCI+D)](https://mhcid.washington.edu/) program. Topics across these courses include prototyping with electronics, microcontrollers, code, 3D printers, and lo-fi craft material. See our [teaching website](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/physcomp/) for more details.

### Acknowledgments and funding
The [Makeability Lab](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu) is grateful for funding support from the NSF, the Department of Defense's Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine Research Program, the [PacTrans Consortium](http://depts.washington.edu/pactrans/),  [UW CREATE](https://create.uw.edu/), [UW's Global Innovation Fund](https://www.washington.edu/globalaffairs/gif/), and [the UW Reality Lab](https://realitylab.uw.edu/) as well as corporate sponsors, including: Google Faculty Research Awards, a 3M Faculty Award, and research funding from Facebook, Nokia, and Microsoft. We are also grateful for our PhD student funding awards, including two Google PhD Fellowships, an IBM Fellowship, and a [Microsoft Dissertation Grant](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/dissertation-grant/?OCID=msr_program_dissgrant_tw#!grant-recipients).

We are honored and humbled that our work has been recognized with sixteen Best Paper and Honorable Mention Awards, including five Best Papers at CHI, two Best Papers at ASSETS, and a 10-Year Impact Award at UbiComp.
