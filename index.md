Hi ðŸ‘‹,

I'm Jon, an Associate Professor in Human-Computer Interaction at UW's [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://cs.washington.edu/) where I work with an extraordinary set of [students and collaborators](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/people/) on problems related to accessibility, urban informatics, environmental sustainability, and STEM education.

At UW, I direct the [Makeability Lab](http://makeabilitylab.io/) and am an Associate Director of [CREATE](https://create.uw.edu/), an Executive Committee member of the [MHCI+D program](https://mhcid.washington.edu/), and a co-founding member of [DUB](http://dub.washington.edu), a large, cross-disciplinary organization of academic and industry professionals interested in HCI and Design research. I'm also the co-founder of [Project Sidewalk](http://projectsidewalk.org/), a web tool aimed at transforming how sidewalks are mapped, analyzed, and visualized using crowdsourcing+AI.

The [Makeability Lab](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu) is grateful for funding support from the NSF, the Department of Defense's Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine Research Program, the PacTrans Consortium,  [UW CREATE](https://create.uw.edu/), and [the UW Reality Lab](https://realitylab.uw.edu/) as well as corporate sponsors, including: Google Faculty Research Awards, a 3M Faculty Award, Nokia, and Microsoft. We are also grateful that our PhD students have been awarded two Google PhD Fellowships and an IBM Fellowship.

We are honored and humbled that our work has been recognized with fourteen Best Paper and Honorable Mention Awards, including five Best Papers at CHI, two Best Papers at ASSETS, and a 10-Year Impact Award at UbiComp.

You can learn more about our work by following the Makeability Lab twitter account [here](http://twitter.com/makeabilitylab).
